## Description

This web application is an internet auction similar to the Dutch internet auction. This is a type of auction in which the seller's advertised high price for the lot is gradually reduced to that which the first buyer agrees to. This buyer becomes the winner of the auction and the owner of the lot. Viewing the current price is paid.

[Demo](https://shop-6d93c.web.app/#/)

## How it's work

1. Find the lot of interest.
2. In lot description you can see start price, and the cost of viewing the price. But current price is hidden (Current price may be significantly less then the current price). 
3. If you nevertheless decide to view the current price, then after confirming the payment, you will have some time to buy this lot for the specified price. If you have not bought a lot at the specified time, then it continues to take part in the trade, but its current price has already become lower.
